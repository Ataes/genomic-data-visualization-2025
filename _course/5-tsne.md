order: 5

# Lecture

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should understand what is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and how to apply it to our spatial transcriptomic datasets.

---

# Hands-on Component

Our in-class hands-on component will analyzing our spatial transcriptomics datasets to create a data visualization using tSNE. We will also use [`patchwork` to create a multipanel plot](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/).

# Homework Assignment

Make a new data visualization of your spatial transcriptomics dataset with a minimum of 2 panels using the dimensionality reduction approaches we have been learning about in class.

Additional details: [genomic-data-visualization-HW_3.pptx (click to download)]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/hw/genomic-data-visualization-HW_3.pptx)

Use the same process from `HW_1` for what is expected and how to submit your homework to the folder `hw3/`.
